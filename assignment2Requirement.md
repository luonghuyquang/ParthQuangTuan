This assignment has again two parts. 



This assignment is done in your assignment group - especially the experimenting part 2 and the discussions on experimentations there!



Part 1  (Familiarizing and basic testing with the k-means algorithm)(5 pts)

Find some other interesting dataset than the Iris dataset from Kaggle on which you can perform k-means clustering/classification (1 pts)
DONE
Run k-means algorithm on that data. You should use the k-means sklearn version. (2pts)
--> 

List 2 interesting use cases for applying k-means algorithm for real world.
These may or may not be business cases. (2 pts)


Part 2 (Experimenting with the k-means algorithm more in detail) (7.5 pts)

Make experiments on your algorithms with different values of k  (1 pts)
Utilize the Elbow method  (2 pts). 
Think how is the situation now different from supervised learning (kNN) case (2.5 pts)

Test the effect of various options of the k-means algorithm. (See the sklearn documentation for k-means)  (2 pts)

Decide which experiments you show on submit video. No need to show everything by everyone. 
Be prepared for discussions on your various observations for the review session later on


Submission guidelines

Make a max(!) 15 minute (group) video where you go through the parts 1 and 2 with your group. It is sufficient to show in part 1 that k-means works on some student's computer but you need to mention quickly how is it for every member in your group. Show what you have found for real world cases and explain those cases briefly but clearly! Have a short discussion on those real world cases on the video with all of your group members!

For the part 2 show and explain the experiments you have carried out for your dataset. It is probable that you cannot cover all the experiments you have carried out during your studying but provide summary explanation. Also cover how members in your group have participated in experimenting.

It is good to note that in the review session then later on I am expecting you to be able to discuss on those experimentations again. So this is a good place to get things done and prepare yourselves for that also.
